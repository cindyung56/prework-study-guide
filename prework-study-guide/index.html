      <section class="card" id="html-section">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is a markup language used to create content for a web page.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Metadata is information that helps render the webpage on the browser, unseen to the user.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE html is not case sensitive, but HTML elements are.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Headings can be created using h1 through h6.</li>
          <li>Paragraphs can be created using the p tag. Line breaks can added using br.</li>
          <li>We can create unordered or ordered lists using ul or ol (respectively). List items are always created with li.</li>
          <li>The img tag adds an image to the web page using the attributes source (src) and alternative text (alt).</li>
          <li>The anchor tag is created using a and includes the attribute href which includes the URL to the external source.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to do styling on a web page. It is recommended to do styling separately so it is easier to change and access later.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We can create a border around the element.</li>
          <li>We can also create a box shadow around the box.</li>
          <li>Classes can be added to elements, which then can be used in CSS to apply the same styling to a group of elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switches to the main branch if not originally on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds code to the current branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description-goes-here": commit files to the branch with a snapshot of currently saved changes</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: check if the local branch is in sync with the main branch, always recommended to check for the latest version</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: push changes from remote branch to local branch</li>
          <li>Once pushed, compare and pull the request on GitHub, and create the pull request (PR).</li>
          <li>Make sure other collaborators see this change and approve before merging PR.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is used to add interactivity and animation to a web page, separate from CSS and HTML. Like styling, it is recommended to do this externally.</li>
          <li>JavaScript has various data types, such as int, string, arrays, etc.</li>
          <li>A string is a word or phrase in two quotation marks " ".</li>
          <li>A variable stores a value, and then can be called later in the code.</li>
          <li>console.log(x) displays x on the console. We can see the console using Chrome Dev Tools.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes its code. i.e. a variable must be defined before it can be logged on the console.</li>
          <li>An if statement is used for conditional logic. If the statement is considered truthy, the code inside runs. If it is falsy, it does not run.</li>
          <li>We can use else if and else to add more conditions to an if statement.</li>
          <li>Three equal signs === are used to compare two values and see if they are equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a group/container of items created using two square brackets [ ]. It can store different types of data.</li>
          <li>An index is a unique number that refers to a specific location in an array. We use indexes to access specific information from the array.</li>
          <li>A for loop repeats a block of code for a specified amount of times. To create a for loop, we need a variable, a condition, and a statement to change the variable's value.</li>
          <li>array.length returns the number of items in the array.</li>
        </ul>
