# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a web page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose was to write down notes and concepts about these three languages and Git for an easy-to-access study guide. This study guide will be useful to refer back to the prework notes before bootcamp starts on August 8th. Along the way, I learned many things about how to use Git to create and push changes to repositories on GitHub and the basics of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I had previous experience, it was great review for me to go over these concepts again and practice using them in an actual project.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to review concepts about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section is divided up properly into its own topic, so one can choose to read it section by section instead of a giant paragraph of text. The bullet points also help in creating more concise points of importance. If using Chrome Dev Tools, the user can open up the console and see the output of the JavaScript code; it will also give a suggestion on which topic to study first.
